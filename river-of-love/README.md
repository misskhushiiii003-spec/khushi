River of My Love — single-page romantic surprise

How it works
- The shared link title is intentionally set to: "🚨 Scam Link – Don’t Click" so it looks like a playful trap in chats.
- Opening the link and clicking the overlay reveals the cinematic message and gentle animations.

Files
- `index.html` — single page
- `style.css` — visual theme and responsive layout
- `script.js` — interactions, canvas hearts, reveal logic
- `music.mp3` — placeholder; replace with your own (no bundled copyrighted music)

Customize
- Replace `music.mp3` with an MP3 you own (or edit `index.html` to use a YouTube embed).
- Change the share title by editing the `<title>` and Open Graph meta tags in `index.html`.

Preview locally
1. cd river-of-love
2. python -m http.server 8080
3. Open http://localhost:8080

Accessibility & privacy
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` (animations disabled when set).
- Audio will only play after a user gesture (the reveal click).

Want me to:
- Commit & publish this to your repo and enable GitHub Pages? (I can do that.)
- Replace the placeholder audio with a specific MP3 you provide? (paste URL or upload)
- Export a ZIP for sharing?
